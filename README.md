# DBML2Drizzle


üöß ‚ö†Ô∏è DBML2Drizzle is a project in its early stages and is not yet a completed tool. However, it provides a foundation for bidirectional schema conversion between DBML (Database Markup Language) and Drizzle-ORM.

Since I currently have limited time to dedicate to this project, I invite others to contribute and help bring it to completion. Your contributions are invaluable in shaping DBML2Drizzle into a powerful and versatile schema conversion tool.
